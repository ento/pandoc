This is a set of tests for pandoc. Most of them are adapted from John Gruber’s
markdown test suite.

! Headers

!! Level 2 with an link:/url[embedded link]

!!! Level 3 with _emphasis_

!!!! Level 4

!!!!! Level 5

! Level 1

!! Level 2 with _emphasis_

!!! Level 3

with no blank line

!! Level 2

with no blank line

! Paragraphs

Here’s a regular paragraph.

In Markdown 1.0.0 and earlier. Version 8. This line turns into a list item.
Because a hard-wrapped line in the middle of a paragraph looked like a list
item.

Here’s one with a bullet. * criminey.

There should be a hard line break +
here.

---

! Block Quotes

E-mail style:

> This is a block quote. It is pretty short.

<<<
Code in a block quote:

```
sub status {
    print "working";
}
```

A list:

# item one
# item two

Nested block quotes:

> nested

> nested
<<<

This should not be a block quote: 2 > 1.

And a following paragraph.

---

! Code Blocks

Code:

```
---- (should be four hyphens)

sub status {
    print "working";
}

this code block is indented by one tab
```

And:

```
    this code block is indented by two tabs

These should not be escaped:  \$ \\ \> \[ \{
```

  computer</p>

# sublist
# sublist
</p>

! HTML Blocks

Simple block on one line:

<div>

foo

</div>

And nested without indentation:

<div>

<div>

<div>

foo

</div>

</div>

<div>

bar

</div>

</div>

Interpreted markdown in a table:

```
<table>
```
```
<tr>
```
```
<td>
```

This is //emphasized//

```
</td>
```
```
<td>
```

And this is ''strong''

```
</td>
```
```
</tr>
```
```
</table>
```
```
<script type="text/javascript">document.write('This *should not* be interpreted as markdown');</script>
```

Here’s a simple block:

<div>

foo

</div>

This should be a code block, though:

```
<div>
    foo
</div>
```

As should this:

```
<div>foo</div>
```

Now, nested:

<div>

<div>

<div>

foo

</div>

</div>

</div>

This should just be an HTML comment:

```
<!-- Comment -->
```

Multiline:

```
<!--
Blah
Blah
-->
```
```
<!--
    This is another comment.
-->
```

Code block:

```
<!-- Comment -->
```

Just plain comment, with trailing spaces on the line:

```
<!-- foo -->
```

Code:

```
<hr />
```

Hr’s:

```
<hr>
```
```
<hr />
```
```
<hr />
```
```
<hr>
```
```
<hr />
```
```
<hr />
```
```
<hr class="foo" id="bar" />
```
```
<hr class="foo" id="bar" />
```
```
<hr class="foo" id="bar">
```

! Inline Markup

This is //emphasized//, and so //is this//.

This is ''strong'', and so ''is this''.

An //[[emphasized link|/url]]//.

''//This is strong and em.//''

So is ''//this//'' word.

''//This is strong and em.//''

So is ''//this//'' word.

This is code: `>`, `$`, `\`, `\$`, `<html>`.

~~This is ''strikeout''.~~

Superscripts: a^^bc^^d a^^//hello//^^ a^^hello there^^.

Subscripts: H,,2,,O, H,,23,O, H,,many of them,,O.

These should not be superscripts or subscripts, because of the unescaped
spaces: a^b c^d, a~b c~d.

---

! Smart quotes, ellipses, dashes

"Hello," said the spider. "'Shelob' is my name."

'A', 'B', and 'C' are letters.

'Oak,' 'elm,' and 'beech' are names of trees. So is 'pine.'

'He said, "I want to go."' Were you alive in the 70's?

Here is some quoted '`code`' and a "[[quoted
link|http://example.com/?foo=1&bar=2]]".

Some dashes: one---two --- three---four --- five.

Dashes between numbers: 5--7, 255--66, 1987--1999.

Ellipses...and...and....

! LaTeX

* $$2+2=4$$
* $$x \in y$$
* $$\alpha \wedge \omega$$
* $$223$$
* $$p$$-Tree
* Here's some display math:<p>

    $$\frac{d}{dx}f(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$</p>
* Here's one that has a line break in it: $$\alpha + \omega \times x^2$$.

These shouldn’t be math:

* To get the famous equation, write `$e = mc^2$`.
* $22,000 is a //lot// of money. So is $34,000. (It worked if "lot" is emphasized.)
* Shoes ($20) and socks ($5).
* Escaped `$`: $73 //this should be emphasized// 23$.

Here’s a LaTeX table:

```
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
Animal & Number \\ \hline
Dog    & 2      \\
Cat    & 1      \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
```

---

! Special Characters

Here is some unicode:

* I hat: Î
* o umlaut: ö
* section: §
* set membership: ∈
* copyright: ©

AT&T has an ampersand in their name.

AT&T is another way to write it.

This & that.

4 < 5.

6 > 5.

Backslash: \\

Backtick: \`

Asterisk: \*

Underscore: _

Left brace: {

Right brace: }

Left bracket: [

Right bracket: ]

Right paren: )

Greater-than: >

Hash: #

[[Email link|mailto:nobody@nowhere.net]]

[[Empty|]].

!! Reference

Foo [ext[bar|/url/]].

With [ext[embedded [brackets]|/url/]].

[ext[b|/url/]] by itself should be a link.

Indented [ext[once|/url]].

Indented [ext[twice|/url]].

Indented [ext[thrice|/url]].

This should [not][] be a link.

```
[not]: /url
```

Foo [ext[bar|/url/]].

!! With ampersands

Here's a [link with an ampersand in the URL](http://example.com/?foo=1&bar=2).

Here's a link with an amersand in the link text:
<a href="http://att.com/" title="AT&amp;T">AT&amp;T</a>.

Here's an [ext[inline link|/script?foo=1&bar=2]].

Here's an [ext[inline link in pointy braces|/script?foo=1&bar=2]].

!! Autolinks

With an ampersand: http://example.com/?foo=1&bar=2

* In a list?
* http://example.com/
* It should.

An e-mail address: nobody@nowhere.net

<<<
Blockquoted: http://example.com/
<<<

Auto-links should not occur here: `<http://example.com/>`

```
or here: <http://example.com/>
```

! Images

From "Voyage dans la Lune" by Georges Melies (1902):

[img alt="lalune" [Voyage dans la Lune|lalune.jpg]]

Here is a movie [img alt="movie" [movie.jpg]] icon.

---

! Footnotes

Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^2] This should //not// be a
footnote reference, because it contains a space.\[\^my note\] Here is an
inline note.[^3]

> Notes can go in quotes.[^4]

# And in list items.[^5]

This paragraph should not be part of the note, as it is not indented.

[^1]: Here is the footnote. It can go anywhere after the footnote reference.
    It need not be placed at the end of the document.

[^2]: Here's the long note. This one contains multiple blocks.

    Subsequent blocks are indented to show that they belong to the footnote
    (as with list items).

          { <code> }

    If you want, you can indent every line, but you can also be lazy and just
    indent the first line of each block.

[^3]: This is //easier// to type. Inline notes may contain
    [[links|http://google.com]] and `]` verbatim characters, as well as
    \[bracketed text\].

[^4]: In quote.

[^5]: In list.
